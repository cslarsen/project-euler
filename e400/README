Some notes:

- It SEEMS every 6th numbers starting from f(7) is 0:

      f(7) = f(13) = f(19) = f(25) = 0

  If so, then f(1 + n*6) = 0 for n>0.

- It also SEEMS that all f(k) are odd numbers.

- When plotted logarithmically, they almost form a
  straight line, with some dents.

- Notice that f(8), f(14), f(20) (delta=6) almost
  seem to form a logarithmic line.  Their values are:

    k     f
   --------
    8     7
   14    93
   20  1383
   26 20151
